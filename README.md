# unity-webgl-socket-framework
Unity webGL build, node server, and mobile react client for creating jackbox style games. Not completed yet (the unity project is still empty).

Go to server and run npm run build, then npm start. go to client and run npm start. 

Server and client are completely separate projects. This is probably bad, but the client will eventuailly be "static" hosted, all client-side.

The server should be able to run headless as a little npm console app, or hosted in heroku or such.
